//global variables (variables at the top, accessible anywhere)
//variable names / types:
  //int (integer)
  //float(number with decimal / rational)
  //color(store integer that represent color)
  //boolean(stores true or false)
  //string(stores text)
  //char(a single character)
  
//declaring a variable, creates a new variable, gives
//it a name, and locks in the type of value it stores


//rules for naming variables:
  //1. only use letters, numbers, dollar sign (but no other symbols,
  //including spaces)
  //2. if more than one word, first word is lowercase,
  //but every subsequent word is capitalized
  
//example:
  
int xpos = 400;

//int only appears once: that is, at the beginning
//"=" is for declaring values. It is NOT an equation

void setup(){
 size(800,600);
 xpos = 400; //this makes the circle stationary by itself,
          //but it has the POTENTIAL to move
}

void draw(){
  background(0);
  
  pushMatrix();
  translate(xpos, 0);
  face(xpos,200);
  popMatrix();
  
  xpos = xpos-5;
  if (xpos < -100)//parentheses have the CONDITIONS of the if statement
  {
    xpos = 1000;
  }
  
}
void face(int x, int y)//local variables
{ 

  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,300,100,100);
  fill(100);
  ellipse(x-15,275,12.5,12.5);
  ellipse(x+15,275,12.5,12.5);
