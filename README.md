# Programming 12 Review
This repository contains files and projects made at the start of the Programming 12 course, namely the review unit. Files include notes on variables, functions, and mode frameworks. A general summary of relevant notes is shown below.


Global variables (variables at the top, accessible anywhere)
Local variables


Variable names / types:

    int (integer)

    float(number with decimal / rational)

    color(store integer that represent color)
 
    boolean(stores true or false)

    string(stores text)

    char(a single character)

  
Declaring a variable is creating a new variable, giving it a name, and locking in the type of value it stores.


Rules for naming variables:

    1. Only use letters, numbers, dollar sign (but no other symbols, including spaces).
  
    2. If there is more than one word, the first word is lowercase, but every subsequent word is capitalized.
  

int, float, boolean... only appears once: that is, at the beginning.


Reminder:   "=" is for declaring values, NOT an equation.
            Use two consecutive '=' for equal here. Single '=' is used to assign values, double '=' is used to compare values. If there is one bracket, '=' ; two brackets, '=='.
